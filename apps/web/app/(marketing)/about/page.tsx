            Founded in 2018, Yuki began with a simple vision: to create software
            that feels human. Our founders, experienced developers frustrated by
            overly complex tools, set out to build solutions that combine
            powerful functionality with intuitive design.
          </p>
          <p>
            What started as a small team of three passionate engineers in a
            co-working space has grown into a global company with offices in
            four countries and a team of over 50 dedicated professionals.
            Throughout our journey, we&apos;ve remained committed to our core
            belief that technology should simplify, not complicate, the lives of
            its users.

              full potential.
