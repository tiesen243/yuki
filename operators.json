Owing to its main searchlight function lacking use value, and its cover fire capacity being limited in its target market, its production has been halted. Before the Rhodes Island Engineering Department got their hands on her, \"Justice Knight\" had already gone through a dozen modifications, big and small; her present capabilities are easily a far cry from the original model. Her old operating system and command memory data were damaged, unable to be recovered. After a swap for new core hardware and an expanded memory unit, an updated operating system plus additional artificial voice system, she is now hardly distinguishable from Raythean Industries's latest operation platforms. \"Justice Knight\" is a member of Pinus Sylvestris Knightclub, and is currently authorized for use by Rhodes Island.",
